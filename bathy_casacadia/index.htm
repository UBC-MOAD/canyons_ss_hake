<h2>
Introduction</h2>
This report contains a 250-meter digital elevation model (DEM) for Cascadia
(latitude 39N - 53N, longitude 116W - 133W), a region that encompasses
the Cascade volcanic arc, the Cascadia subduction zone, and the Juan de
Fuca Ridge system. The DEM is distributed as file <b><font size=+1><a href="http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of99-369/cascdem.tar.gz">cascdem.tar.gz</a></font></b>&nbsp;
(39 MB; 78MB uncompressed).
<p>Cascdem.tar.gz includes the following files:

<p>The DEM contains elevation values in integer meters, at regularly-spaced
points in a Lambert conformal conic projection with standard parallels
at latitudes 41.5N and 50.5N, and a central longitude of 124.5W (the "Cascadia"
projection.).

<p>A 1:2,000,000-scale color shaded-relief map prepared from this DEM,
with an interpretation of the physiography of Cascadia, is in press as
U.S. Geological Survey map I-2689.
<p>To ease data transfer for the widest possible range of users, the DEM
is distributed as a BIL (Band Interleave by Line) file, produced with the
ARC GRIDIMAGE command. For grids (the ARC term for a DEM in the form of
a regular array of height values), such files are more compact than ARC
export (.e00) files and USGS DEM-format files, and are much faster to create
and import. They can also be read by many applications other than ARC.
<tt>cascadia.bil
</tt>is
such a file of binary integers. Elevations are stored in <tt>cascadia.bil</tt>
as unsigned positive 2-byte binary integers, in Motorola byte-order (default
for Sun hardware), with an offset of 10000. That is, 203 meters is stored
as 10203 meters, and values less than 10000 represent negative elevations.
Values of 0 in <tt>cascadia.bil</tt> represent no data. Values are given
by row, west to east, starting at the north edge of the region.
<h2>
To convert CASCADIA files to an ARC grid</h2>
Assemble the cascadia.* files (.bil, .blw, .hdr, prj; .stx is not necessary)
in one directory. Make this your workspace.
<blockquote><tt>Arc: imagegrid cascadia casc1</tt>
<br><tt>Arc: grid</tt>
<br><tt>Grid: casc2 = con(casc1 &lt;> 0, casc1 - 10000)</tt>
<br><tt>Grid: &amp;sys cp cascadia.prj casc2/prj.adf</tt></blockquote>
If you DESCRIBE casc2 in ARC, you should get
<blockquote><tt>Description of Grid CASC2</tt>
<p><tt>Cell Size = 250.000 Data Type: Integer</tt>
<br><tt>Number of Rows = 6435 Number of Values = 8555</tt>

<h2>
To use the SOURCES coverage</h2>
Sources.e00 is only accessible with ARC/INFO. Copy sources.e00 to an appropriate
directory, start ARC/INFO, make this directory your workspace, and type
<blockquote><tt>Arc: import cover sources sources</tt></blockquote>
to convert the export file into a usable coverage named <b><tt>sources</tt></b>.
<p>Coverage <b><tt>sources</tt></b> was created with the ARC GRIDPOLY command
from a 250-m grid. It does not provide a usable shoreline!
<h2>
How the DEM was compiled</h2>
To make the DEM, data from many sources were resampled at a 250-m interval
in the Cascadia map projection and composited. The software used for projecting
the data (ARC/INFO GRID, version 7.0.3) does not allow for explicit registration
of the output grid, and as a result there are lateral shifts of potentially
as much as one grid cell (250 meters) between blocks of data. These shifts
appear to be insignificant at this resolution. Data sets 14, 15, and 16
(see below) were combined, interpolated, and gridded together to produce
a surface that is smooth at the data-set boundaries.
<p>One-cell-wide gaps between data blocks that resulted from lateral shifts
were filled with the focal mean of surrounding values. Wider gaps were
locally present at some shoreline locations, where marine and terrestrial
data were truncated at different shorelines. These were filled with value
Z = 0.
<p>Marine and terrestrial data were merged with the naive assumption that
they are measured in relation to the same vertical datum. This is not so:
marine depths are relative to Mean Lower Low Water, whereas terrestrial
elevations were measured from datums which are approximately equivalent
to Mean Sea Level. The difference is most acute in the southern end of
Puget Sound (Washington State), where the vertical datums differ by about
2 meters.
<h2>
Artifacts</h2>
Lack of data makes most of the floor of the northeastern Pacific Ocean
appear smooth. Some of the smoothness is real, reflecting a blanket of
sediment that smothers the oceanic-ridge topography beneath it. But most
of the smoothness simply reflects insufficient data--compare the areas
from sources 14, 15, and 16 with adjacent areas of high-resolution multibeam
sonar surveys (sources 2 and 3). Similarly, apparent differences in the
physiography of the Washington continental slope, relative to adjoining
parts of the slope, at least partly reflect differences in data quality.
Additional artifacts result from mismatches between sets of source data.
Perhaps the most obvious mismatch is at longitude 132&deg;W, extending
south from 52&deg;N, where an abrupt change in apparent depth occurs at
a source-data boundary. Abrupt northward termination at 46&deg;N of longitudinal
ridges in the Juan de Fuca Slope also reflects juxtaposition of differing
data sources.
