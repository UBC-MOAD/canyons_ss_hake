The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for development and testing of
the bathymetry (IDEALIZED and REALISTIC) used in the Mackenzie NEMO model configuration.

* ##[Exploring_netcdf_files.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/sasahu/practise/raw/tip/gyre/Exploring_netcdf_files.ipynb)  
    
    Exploring Net CDf files and how to work with them in python from the analysis tool in the Salish Sea Meopar tool repo.  
      
      
    Importing netcdf4 library, numpy array and nc_tools from salish_sea_tools and aliasing the netcdf library and numpy array as nc and np respectively  


* ##[tracers_on_horizontal_plane_gyre_run.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/sasahu/practise/raw/tip/gyre/tracers_on_horizontal_plane_gyre_run.ipynb)  
    
      
    Objectives:  
      
        1) Reading tracer variable values from NEMO *grid_T.nc results files  
          
        2) Plotting sea surface height fields at selected times  
          
        3) Approximate land areas masks for tracer field plots  
          
        4) Using slices to zoom in on domain regions  
          
        5) Plotting contour bands and lines  
          
        6) Plotting temperature fields at selected depths  
          
        7) Adding contour lines to colour mesh plots  
          
        8) Anomaly plots  
          
        9) Plotting salinity fields with various colour scales
